<h2 id="metro_style_design">Metro style design</h2>

<ul>
<li>There are no apps yet. Opportunity.</li>
<li>Sidebars are for the system, top and bottom are for the app</li>
<li>Win32 vs Metro apps</li>
<li>Content before Chrome</li>
<li>Apps re-imagined</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fast_and_fluid">Fast and Fluid</h2>

<ul>
<li>Touch faster than GUI, GUI faster than command line</li>
<li>Touch first approach</li>
<li>Beautiful, fast, and fluid vs crap</li>
<li>Most controls support animation</li>
<li>Touch has its own language, don’t mimic the mouse</li>
<li>Semantic zoom: not only does the content change, 
but also the meaning (e.g. show categories rather than details)</li>
<li>Don’t separate touch and mouse interfaces</li>
<li>A screen without touch is a broken screen - in a few years</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="snap_and_scale_beautifully_form_factor">Snap and Scale beautifully (form factor)</h2>

<ul>
<li>minimal: 1024x768 </li>
<li>widescreen: 1366x768+</li>
<li>snap view (required)</li>
<li>portrait (optional) </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use_the_right_contracts">Use the right contracts</h2>

<ul>
<li>Binds metro style apps together</li>
<li>Share, Search, and Picker</li>
<li>Share content with other apps (e-mail, social network)</li>
<li>Search: each app implements its own view</li>
<li>Picker: select a picture from file system or the web 
(sample: change user profile picture from a picture in Facebook 
without having to do the intermediate step of saving picture in 
my hard drive first)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="invest_in_a_great_tile">Invest in a great Tile</h2>

<ul>
<li>Icons are yesterday’s way of representing apps</li>
<li>The Tile should be an extension of the app</li>
<li>You can also create tiles from content of the app (e.g. tile 
your favorite photos album or weather from SCE)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feel_connected">Feel connected</h2>

<ul>
<li>“Windows is alive with activity”</li>
<li>Live tiles</li>
<li>We don’t have folders, we have groups</li>
<li>Folders put stuff down one level, it’s hard to name them</li>
<li>People do love to make groups</li>
<li>Notifications are displayed for a small period of time, after 
that update the tile</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="roam_to_the_cloud">Roam to the cloud</h2>

<ul>
<li>Every app gets per-user cloud storage for settings, state, 
and small amount of user content (via Live ID)</li>
<li>Applications preserve state as they go, do not require explicit save</li>
<li>Roam settings (favorite cities, last level on game played)</li>
</ul>
