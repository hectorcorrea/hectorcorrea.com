<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>The source code for this site is all mine. However, in order to build it I used several great open source tools and frameworks. The code was written entirely in JavaScript. I am using Node.js and Express.js on the server side and Angular.JS on the client side. The data is stored in a MongoDB database.</p>

<p>You can see and <b>download the source code</b> for this site from <a href="https://github.com/hectorcorrea/hectorcorrea.com" target="_blank">this github repo.</a></p>

<p>The CSS for the site is based almost entirely on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br/>
Hector Correa</p>
