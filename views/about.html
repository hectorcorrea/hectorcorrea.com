<h1>About</h1>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>I am a software developer in the New England area that enjoys delivering
      great products to users. Coding and building systems is both my passion
      and my hobby. This site is where I host <a href="/blog">my blog</a> and
      post small articles about software development as well as code samples.</p>

    <p>I've been developing web applications for many years. Currently I am
      working on a Solr/Blacklight application that powers the
      <a href="https://search.library.brown.edu/" target="_blank">discovery layer</a>
      at the Brown University Library and I am also involved on the development
      of <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Researchers at Brown</a>
      (a VIVO app). Before Brown I worked at Penn State on ScholarSphere, a Ruby on Rails application
      that serves as the institutional repository and uses the SamVera Framework (formerly Hydra).
      For many years I was also heavily involved on the Microsoft stack (C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server)
      building complex and high-volume applications for a variety of industries.</p>

    <p>My main areas of interest are web development in small
      and collaborative teams. I also enjoy learning new and
      interesting technologies and you'll find a wide variety
      of topics in my blog including algorithms and data structures,
      Ruby on Rails, Node.js/JavaScript, C#/ASP.NET MVC, Go,
      NoSQL databases, event-driven architectures, and bit of
      functional programming.</p>

    <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from
      Colima's Technology Institute (Mexico) and several
      certifications including Microsoft Certified Software
      Developer (MCSD), ScrumMaster, and MongoDB for Developers (M101P).</p>

    <p>In the last few years I've given presentations at local
      events as well as regional and national conferences in a variety
      of topics including
      <a href="https://github.com/hectorcorrea/solr-for-newbies" target="_blank">Solr</a>,
      <a href="http://hectorcorrea.com/blog/introduction-to-node-js/51" target="_blank">Node.js</a>,
