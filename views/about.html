<h1>About</h1>

  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>I am a software developer in the New England area that enjoys delivering
      great products to users. Coding and building systems is both my passion
      and my hobby. This site is where I host <a href="/blog">my blog</a> and
      post small articles about software development as well as code samples.</p>

    <p>I've been developing web applications for several years. Currently I am
      working on a Solr/Blacklight application that is the front end for the
      discovery layer at the Brown University Library. I am also involved in
      other software development initiatives at the library including our
      researchers profile application (a VIVO app). The last couple of years I
      worked at Penn State on a Ruby on Rails project to power document
      repositories for libraries using the
      <a href="https://github.com/projecthydra" target="_blank">Hydra Framework</a>.
      For many years I was also heavily involved on the Microsoft stack
      (C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server) building complex and high-volume applications
      for a variety of industries.</p>

    <p>My main areas of interest are web development in small
      and collaborative teams. I also enjoy learning new and
      interesting technologies and you'll find a wide variety
      of topics in my blog including algorithms and data structures,
      Ruby on Rails, Node.js/JavaScript, C#/ASP.NET MVC, Go,
      NoSQL databases, event-driven architectures, and bit of
      functional programming.</p>

    <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from
      Colima's Technology Institute (Mexico) and several
      certifications including Microsoft Certified Software
      Developer (MCSD), ScrumMaster, and MongoDB for Developers (M101P).</p>

    <p>In the last few years I've given presentations at local
      events and user groups in a variety of topics including
      CoffeeScript, Node.js, NoSQL/MongoDB, and Linked Data.</p>
